# Chapter-3

Use methods similar to those in Sec7on 3.5.1 to op7mize the geometry of H2O and hydrogen cyanide, HCN. HCN is a highly toxic gas that is nonetheless manufactured in large quan77es because of its use as a chemical precursor in a wide range of industrial processes. Ensure that you have sampled all relevant degrees of freedom by showing that mul7ple ini7al geometries for each molecule converge to the same final state. Compare your calculated geometries with experimental data
